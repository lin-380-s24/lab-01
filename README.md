## Preparation

- Read/ annotate: [Recipe \#1](https://qtalr.github.io/qtalrkit/articles/recipe-1.html). You can refer back to this document to help you at any point during this lab activity.

## Objectives

- Review accessing a lab activity, creating a Quarto document, and exporting it as a report
- Practice your ability to use basic Markdown syntax
- Learn to use common elements in academic writing (i.e. citations, figures, tables, *etc*.) using Quarto
- Discover and summarize literature on text analysis in an area of interest to you

## Instructions

### Getting started

1. Create a Quarto document using the RStudio toolbar
  - Provide the title: "Academic writing with Quarto"
  - Provide the author: \<Your Name\>
2. Render the Quarto document (without changes)
  - Click the 'Knit' button on the RStudio toolbar
  - Save the Quarto file with the name `lab-1.qmd`.

### Using Quarto for academic writing

Using the academic article you found in the preparation for this lab, respond to the following questions in your `.qmd` document:

- What is the research question?
- What is the data used to answer the research question?
- What is the method used to answer the research question?
- What are the results of the analysis?

In your responses use various options provided by the basic Markdown syntax to format your response. Also include numbered sections and subsections to organize your response. Finally, make sure to include a citation for the article you are summarizing and create a section at the end of your document for references.

2. Render the `.qmd` as a PDF or a Word document

3. (optional) Explore adding a markdown table to your Quarto document and make a cross-reference in your summary prose.
   1. This may be useful for summarizing some aspect of the article you are reviewing.
   2. You can also just copy and paste from the example in Recipe #1 to experiment with this feature.
